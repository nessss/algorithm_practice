Doves of Peace, Doves of War

by Ness Morris



The sun was setting on another beautiful day. He sat on his porch, lighting another cigarette. He sipped his ten-year single malt. Looking down the hill and across the valley, he saw a dove land in an oak tree.
At this, he felt a queer familiarity. Perhaps it was just his mind playing tricks on him, but something about the dove flying into that tree to build its nest felt strikingly significant, for no reason Li could discern.
"Did you see that dove? Across the valley, in that oak tree?" he asked Jun.
"No. Why do you ask?" Jun replied.
"No particular reason. It just struck me as something important. Maybe even a portent."
"A portent? Like, as in fortune telling? I thought you considered that all to be superstitious woo-woo nonsense,” Jun said, a wry smile on his face.
"You're right. I don’t believe in predicting the future. I just can't explain how I felt when I saw it. It's like I could tell it was coming home. Almost like deja vu, but I can't remember seeing a dove in that tree before."
"Isn’t that how deja vu works? Maybe you've had enough scotch. It's not like you to ascribe such meaning to coincidental events," Jun said, tapping the ashen tip of his cigar into the ashtray.
"That might be it. It's probably nothing," Li said softly, putting out his cigarette.
"If it is so significant, though," Jun said, "what would it represent?"
"Peace?"
"Maybe. But the war's been over for three years now."
"I think, to the ancient Mesopotamians, doves symbolized love and sexuality," said Li, putting his hand on Jun's thigh.
Taking Li’s hand in his own, Jun replied, "Ah, but to them, didn't doves also symbolize war?"
"That's the thing about symbols; without context, we're free to ascribe any number of contradictory meanings to them. Forget I said anything. Sometimes a bird is just a bird."
Li took back his hand and used it to light another cigarette. The two sat and smoked in serene silence, enjoying the cool evening breeze after the warm summer's day.

That night, Li dreamed he was a dove. He was building a nest in the oak tree across the valley, but as he wove twigs and small branches into the nest, they became bundles of multicolored wires, and plastic tubes full of pale yellow liquid. He looked again at the oak tree, and saw that the leaves were sheets of glass, and the wood was fiberglass etched with copper, where it showed through holes in the linoleum bark.
# 
In the morning, Li went through his usual routine. He wrote in his dream journal, stretched, and went on a bike ride.
On his way back home, he saw the oak tree and decided to stop and take a closer look. He had plenty of time before his shift started at the clinic.
The dove was nowhere to be found, but there was a half-constructed nest, which was odd, as Li was fairly certain that doves make their nests in springtime.
Having only partially satisfied his curiosity, Li made his way home and got ready for work.
# 
The clinic where Li was employed provided a service where those with terminal or debilitating illness were put into medically-induced comas, and their brains electrically stimulated to provide peaceful, painless dream states. He was proud of the work he did, even though he saw himself as a glorified nurse, his duties being such mundane tasks as refilling IV bags, drawing and analyzing blood samples, and reviewing data concerning the neurological stimulation, ensuring that the patients remained unconscious to reality, and absorbed in their electrochemical reveries.
Working with him today was Xiulan, whose company he rather enjoyed. Most of his coworkers preferred to work in silence, listening to music or talk programs on headphones, but Xiulan seemed to enjoy conversation.
"You see any doves lately?" she asked.
Li was taken off-guard. "Doves? Why do you ask?"
"Well, there's this elm tree down the street from my house, and yesterday I evening I swear I saw a dove bringing nest materials back to it. I just thought it was strange, a dove building a nest in the late summer," she clarified as she drew a blood sample from an elderly patient with fibromyalgia.
"As a matter of fact, I saw a similar thing yesterday. Except it was an oak tree for me. And last night I dreamed I was a dove, building a nest," Li said, omitting the details about the nest and tree transforming as he built it.
"Hmm," she sighed softly. "Perhaps the weather control project is affecting the wildlife more drastically than the experts claimed it would."
It was a simple enough answer. Li nodded in agreement. He sat down at a terminal and began to review a patient's brain scans from the night before. All parameters were within the expected ranges, indicating that the patient's dream had been proceeding uninterrupted.
"That's not right. Come over here and take a look at this," said a voice from behind Li.
"What's the issue?" Li said, getting up from his terminal to face Xiulan.
"I didn't say anything," she replied. "Seriously,” she added as Li stared at her, confused. “You must be hearing things."
"Don't joke around. I heard you say there was something wrong. Is there a problem with one of the patients?"
"I'm dead serious. I wouldn't joke like that."
Not entirely convinced, Li sat back down at the terminal and tried to put the issue out of his mind. He couldn't help but let his mind wander, though, when he was looking through the brain scans and finding nothing out of the ordinary. That voice, now that he thought about it, didn't quite have the qualities of Xiulan's; she had a more cheerful, melodic voice than the one he heard. She certainly had a sense of humor, but it would be unlike her to joke about a problem with a patient, and she never really put on voices like that.
He put his mind back to his work, and checked another patient's scans. He couldn't shake a vague feeling of unease, but the rest of the workday passed with nothing but idle conversation from Xiulan and routine lab work.
# 
That evening, Li was smoking on the porch with Jun, keeping an eye on the oak tree. Just as the sun was halfway over the horizon, he spotted the dove again, flying into the tree, just like the previous evening.
"There! Did you see it?" Li pointed toward the tree. "It's that dove again."
"On again about that dove? I didn't see a thing. Besides, didn’t you say sometimes a bird is just a bird?”
"Oh, forget about it. It's just that Xiulan, from work, said she saw something similar yesterday, too."
"I think spending so many hours a day around dreaming cadavers is starting to get to you both. Maybe you should ask for some time off, clear your head."
Li nodded in agreement before he could stop himself. He wanted to press the issue, for Jun to take him seriously, but Jun seemed not to be interested. He decided not to mention his dream, or the voice he had heard at work; Jun would probably insist he see a therapist, and Li had been to enough therapy, he felt.
#
That night, he dreamed that he was a patient in his own clinic, wrapped in the nest of tubing and wires from his dream the night before. He tried to move, but his limbs were bound to his bed, as they did with their patients in Li's clinic. He tried to open his mouth to call out, but his throat was blocked by an endotracheal tube, his breathing regulated by a softly whirring machine by his bedside.
Panic began to set in. Relax, he thought to himself. It's just a dream. You'll wake up in a few minutes and then forget all about this.
He could see a wall clock from his bed; it was 3:30 in the morning. He watched the seconds tick by and counted his mechanically-assisted breaths. Twenty one, twenty two, twenty three...
"Ah shit, it's gotten worse. He might even be cognizant right now," said a voice from somewhere in the room Li couldn't see.
"Increase the dose of sedative. If they're not dreaming, they're supposed to be knocked out," said another, more familiar voice. It was the one he heard at the clinic yesterday!
"Sure thing," the first voice replied.
A figure came into view in front of Li's bed, and if his throat weren't blocked by the breathing tube, he would have gasped. It was himself, and he watched his own features on this doppelgänger's face light up in surprise when he looked at Li.
"Holy shit!" this other self said, half shouting. "His eyes are open. That's really not supposed to happen," he said, quickly adjusting something behind the bed, out of view.
Li's heart was racing, but between the regulated breathing and the additional sedative, he only counted another fifteen breaths before his pulse slowed and the dream faded into unremembered sleep.
#
He woke the next morning uneasy, last night's dream still lingering in the corners of his consciousness. He wrote of it in his dream journal, and went to review the previous night's dream, but he found no entry for that day. His disquiet grew; he clearly remembered writing about a dream about a dove, but the details escaped him.
On his morning bike ride, he stopped again at the oak tree, checking for the dove's nest. It was gone; not even a bundle of twigs remained to indicate the nest that had been under construction the previous morning.
Once home, he caught Jun before he went to work.
"Do you remember talking about doves?" he asked. "Last night and the night before?"
"Doves?" Jun replied, a slightly confused smirk on his face. "No, I don’t think I remember anything like that."
"Don’t worry about it," Li said sheepishly. "Forget I said anything." If there was anything wrong with himself, he didn't want to worry his husband until he knew more. He would go to see the doctor after his shift, just to make sure everything was OK with him, at least physiologically.
#
When he got to work, he found that he was again working with Xiulan. He took the opportunity to ask her about their conversation about doves.
"No, I don't remember anything about a dove building a nest. Besides, it's late summer. Don't doves normally build their nests in spring?"
Li demurely agreed, dropped the topic, and got to work drawing blood samples.
"It's happening again."
That voice again! Li spun around to find the source, but only Xiulan and the dreaming patients were in the room with him.
"Did you hear that?" he asked her. She didn't respond, sitting at her terminal reviewing scans. He waved, trying to get her attention, but there was no response.
He opened his mouth to call to her again, but he found his throat was blocked, and while he was indeed breathing, he couldn't control it.
He instinctively tried to reach up to his face, to pull the tube out, but his arms were bound to the bed in which he now realized he was lying.
It must be another dream, he thought, trying not to panic. I'll wake up any moment now and I'll be in bed next to Jun. I'll ask for some time off work, and these dreams will stop. At least this would explain the missing entry in my dream journal, and the fact that Jun and Xiulan don't remember our conversations. 
Something was wrong, though. Things started coming back to him. Flashes of smoke, fire, blood, noise. A knife in his hand, stained a sickly brown. Memories he realized he never wanted to remember were flooding back.

"I want to believe the war is over, has been over for years. I want to forget I ever fought, forget I lost so much. Forget about losing Jun, about losing Xiulan. I want it to be late summer forever. I want to be able to smoke and drink ten-year single malt scotch every evening. Most of all, I want to forget about all those people I killed."
"That should all be fine. We just need a few more details and your simulation profile will be complete, and we'll ready for you to go to sleep, at which point you will only know what you want to know, and do the things you'd like to do," the doctor explained with the polite smile of a travel agent arranging a vacation. "Do you want to have a job? We find that patients who keep busy in their dreams are less likely to unexpectedly wake and recall memories."
"Sure. I don't care what I do, as long as I'm not a soldier."
"Alright then, since you've expressed a desire to do this as economically as possible, we'll set you up with a job in a clinic much like this one. It's the least expensive option; it was the first simulated job we developed, and it’s the most optimized, so it requires less processor time."
"Sounds good to me," said Li, thinking it funny that he was paying extra to have a job in his dream world, and that arguably more desirable jobs would be too expensive for his soldier’s pension, but silently agreeing that it would be good to keep busy, even if it meant he had to cheap out in other areas.
"OK, so just to confirm, your suite includes two fully interactive human characters, a house with a scenic view, a basic exercise program, the smoking and drinking packages, and a clinic job. You've opted not to include a food package, so you simply won't need to eat, and won't think anything of it.” He winced slightly as she mentioned this. Food was one of the areas in which he had decided to save money, and he was already starting to regret it. Hopefully the two ‘fully interactive human characters’ would make up for it. ”Is there anything else you'd like to add?” the doctor continued. “Any favorite animal you might like to see, perhaps?"
Li thought for a moment. "Give me a new face," he said. "I don't care what it looks like. I just don't want this one looking back at me through the mirror. As far as animals go... Cats are nice. Can I have a cat?"
"We can do a new face for free, seeing as you’re not picky. A cat would be one of our more expensive animal options, though. Lots of interactivity, lots of processor time, you see. Maybe something more wild, like a bird? They wouldn’t be able to be kept as pets, unfortunately, but your budget would allow for one species of a wild animal such as a bird or fish. Birds are our most popular budget option."
"A bird? I guess doves would be nice.” A symbol of peace. “Yeah, let's go with doves."
The doctor finished typing Li’s specifications into a terminal. "That should do it," she said, getting up from the terminal and walking toward the door. "Follow me and we'll get you ready for your new life."

He'd read all the fine print before going under, so he knew what would happen soon. He had time to wonder to himself how many times he had woken like this before, but he also knew how effective modern amnesiac drugs were for fresh, short term memories. He was already fading into drug-induced slumber by the time he realized people had surrounded his bed, pushing buttons and turning dials.
#
The sun was setting on another beautiful day. He sat on his porch, lighting another cigarette. He sipped his ten-year single malt. Looking down the hill and across the valley, he saw a dove land in an oak tree.
