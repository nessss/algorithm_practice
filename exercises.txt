1-1 Show that a + b can be less than min(a, b).
    solution: both a and b are negative
              a = -3
              b = -5
              a + b = -8
              min(a, b) = -5
              (a + b) < min(a, b)

1-2 Show that a * b can be less than min(a, b).
    solution: both a and b are less than 1 but greater than zero,
              or at least one of a and b are negative
              (1)
              a = 0.5
              b = 0.8
              a * b = 0.4
              min(a, b) = 0.5
              (a * b) < min(a, b)

              (2)
              a = -3
              b = 5
              a * b = -15
              min(a, b) = -3
              (a * b) < min(a, b)

1-3 Design/draw a road network with two points a and b such that
    the fastest route between a and b is not the shortest route.
    solution: A road network in which there are three points, a
              b, and c. Each point has a road to each other point.
              There are speed limits for each road; the road between
              a and b has a speed limit of 20 km/h, and the roads
              between a and c, and b and c each have a speed limit
              of 50 km/hr. Each road has a length of 1 km.
              Time travelled for each route from a to b:
              a -> b:
                1 km / (20 km/hr) = 0.05 hr = 3 minutes
              a -> c -> b:
                2 km / (50 km/hr) = 0.04 hr = 2.4 minutes

1-4 Design/draw a road network with two points a and b such that
    the fastest route between a and b is not the route with the
    fewest turns.
    solution:   b---------------c

                |               |
                |               |

                a---------------d

                observe that a->d->c->b has two turns, and is 42
                units long. a->e->f->g->h->b has four turns, and is
                14 units long.

1-5 The knapsack problem is as follows: given a set of integers
    S = { s_1, s_2... s_n }, and a target number T, find a subset of
    S which adds up exactly to T. For example, there exists a subset
    within S = { 1, 2, 5, 9, 10 } that adds up to T = 22 but not
    T = 23.
    Find counterexamples to each of the following algorithms for the
    knapsack problem. That is, giving an S and T such that the subset
    that is selected using the algorithm does not leave the knapsack
    completely full, even though such a solution exists.

    (A) Put the elements of S in the knapsack in left to right order
        if they fit, i.e. the first-fit algorithm.
        solution: see knapsack.cpp, first_fit_counterexample().

    (B) Put the elements of S in the knapsack from smallest to largest,
        i.e the best-fit algorithm.
        solution: see knapsack.cpp, best_fit_counterexample().

    (C) Put the elements of S in the knapsack from largest to smallest.
        solution: see knapsack.cpp, greedy_counterexample().


1-6 The set cover problem is as follows: given a set of subsets S_1, ..., S_m
    of the universal set { 1, ... , n } find the smallest subset of subsets
    T subset of S such that every element of U is represented in T. For example,
    there are the following subsets, S_1 = { 1, 3, 5 }, S_2 = { 2, 4 },
    S_3 = { 1, 4 }, and S_4 = { 2, 5 }. The set cover would then be S_1 and S_2.
    Find a counterexample for the following algorithm: Select the largest subset
    for the cover, and then delete all its elements from the universal set.
    Repeat by adding the subset with the largest number of uncovered elements
    from the universal set until all elements are covered.

    solution: see set_cover.cpp, greedy_counterexample(). The key to the
    counterexample is that the best selection of subsets does not include the
    largest subset.


1-7 Prove the correctness of the following recursive algorithm to multiply
    two natural numbers, for all integer constants c >= 2.

    function multiply( y, z )
        comment Return the product y*z.
        if z == 0 then return( 0 )
        else return multiply( c * y, floor( z / c ) ) + y * ( z % c )

    solution:
    c = 2;
    y = 3, z = 4;
    z != 0, so return multiply( 2 * 3, floor( 4 / 2 ) ) + 3 * ( 4 % 2 )
    multiply( 6, 2 ) + 3 * ( 0 )

    return multiply( 2 * 6, floor( 2 / 2 ) ) + 6 * ( 2 % 2 )
    multiply( 12, 1 ) + 0

    return multiply( 2 * 12, floor( 1 / 2 ) ) + 12 * ( 1 % 2 )
    multiply( 24, 0 ) + 12

    z == 0, so return 0 + 12
    result is 12

    ----
    c = 3;
    y = 3, z = 4;
    z != 0, so return multiply( 3 * 3, floor( 4 / 3 ) ) + 3 * ( 4 % 3 )
    multiply( 9, 1 ) + 3
    return multiply( 3 * 9, floor( 1 / 3 ) ) + 9 * ( 1 % 3 ) + 3
    multiply( 27, 0 ) + 9 + 3
    z == 0, so return 9 + 3 = 12


    The algorithm is correct because in all cases, z is reduced to 0 through
    recursion, as the remainder of the maximum multipilcation of c is added at each
    step. Therefore, the result will always be the same as simple multiplication for
    any c >= 2.

1-8 Prove the correctness of the following algorithm for evaluating a polynomial.
    P(x) = a_n * x^n + a_n-1 * x^n-1 ... a_1 * x + a_0
        function horner( A, x )
            p = A_n
            for i from n-1 to 0
                p = p * x + A_i
            return p

    solution: I don't understand the math well enough to understand the problem.

1-9 Prove the correctness of the following sorting algorithm.
        function bubblesort( A: list[1 ... n] )
            int i, j
            for i from n to 1
                for j from 1 to i - 1
                    if A[j] > A[j+1]
                        swap A[j], A[j+1]

    solution: The algorithm is correct because after each pass of the outer loop,
              the maximum unsorted element will end up at its proper position toward
              the end of the list.
              After the outer loop is finished, all sublists in A will be sorted,
              which means that A will be sorted.


1-28 Write a function to perform integer division without using the / or * operators.
     Find a fast way to do it.
     solution: see interview_problems.cpp, test_integer_division()

1-29 There are 25 horses. At most, 5 horses can race together at a time. You must 
     determine the fastest, second fastest, and third fastest horses. Find the 
     minimum number of races in which this can be done.
     solution: If we are able to record the time each horse takes to complete the
               race, the problem is trivial. Simply divide the horses into five
               groups and race each group, recording the time for each horse, and
               pick the three fastest horses.

               However, if we aren't able to time them, then the problem becomes
               more interesting. My intuition tells me to pick five horses at
               random, race them, and then disqualify the slowest two horses.
               Take two more unraced horses at random, and repeat until all horses
               have been raced, and then the fastest three horses in the last race
               will be the fastest three horses in the group.
               This would take eleven races, each race disqualifying two horses,
               leaving the three fastest horses.

               Another solution would be to start as before, racing five random
               horses, and disqualifying the slowest two. Then, take the third
               fastest horse from the first race, and race it against four random
               unraced horses. Only if any of the new horses beat the already-raced
               horse do we have to re-race either of the two fastest horses from the
               first race. If the third-fastest horse from the first race is the
               fastest horse of the second race, all four new horses of the second
               race can be disqualified. If at least two horses in the second race
               are faster than the horse from the first race, the horse from the
               first race can be disqualified.
               In the best case, this solution can find the three fastest horses,
               in order, in eight races. This would occur if the three fastes horses
               happen to be in the first group of five raced.
               In the worst case, this solution will find the three fastest horses
               in fourteen races.

2-1 What value is returned by the following function? Express your answer as a 
    function of n. Give the worst-case running time using Big Oh notation.
        function mystery( n )
            r := 0
            for i := 1 to n - 1 do
                for j := i + 1 to n do
                    for k := 1 to j do
                        r := r + 1
            return( r )

    solution: The function returns the sum of sums ( 1 + 2 + ... n ) +
              ( 1 + 2 + ... n- 1 ) + ... 1, i.e. the nth triangle number. 
              for n = 8, the function returns 8 + 7 + 6 + ... + 1 = 36.
              The function runs in O(n^2) complexity.
              I was wrong. I can't easily describe the relationship between n and
              what the function returns. I am fairly certain, though, that
              it runs in O(n^2) complexity, as n / mystery(n) grows faster than n.

2-2 What value is returned by the following function? Express your answer as a 
    function of n. Give the worst-case running time using Big Oh notation.
        function pesky(n)
            r := 0
            for i := 1 to n do
                for j := 1 to i do
                    for k := j to i + j do
                        r := r + 1
            return( r )
    solution: pesky( n ) ~= 0.66667n + -1n^2 + 0.3333n^3
              This function runs in O(n^3) complexity.


2-3 What value is returned by the following function? Express your answer as a 
    function of n. Give the worst-case running time using Big Oh notation.
        function prestiferous( n )
            r := 0
            for i := 1 to n do
                for j := 1 to i do
                    for k := j to i + j do
                        for l := 1 to i + j - k do
                            r := r + 1
            return( r )

    solution: I'm starting to notice a pattern. I would assume that the additional
              loop would add an additional polynomial term to the equation, and
              that this function would run in O(n^4) time.
              After plotting the output and using grapher to find a best-fit
              polynomial function, I find:
              prestiferous( n ) ~= 0.0307 + 0.1754n + 0.7407n^2 + -0.5741n^3 +
                                   0.1248n^4
              This confirms my suspicions that this function runs in O(n^4) time.

2-4 What value is returned by the following function? Express your answer as a 
    function of n. Give the worst-case running time using Big Oh notation.
        function conundrum( n )
            r := 0
            for i := 1 to n do
                for j := i + 1 to n do
                    for k := i + j - 1 to n do
                        r := r + 1
            return( r )

    solution: Without calculating anything, I would estimate that this function
              runs in O( n^3 ) complexity, due to the level of nested loops.
              After plotting the function's output and finding a best-fit
              polynomial, I found that:
              f( n ) ~= -0.5046 + 2.0092 - 1.4866n^2 + 0.3333n^3
              This confirms my guess that the function runs in O(n^3) complexity.

2-5 Suppose the following algorithm is used to evaluate the polynomial
    p(x) = a_n * x^n + a_n-1 * x^n-1 + ... a_1 * x + a_0

        p := a_0
        xpower := 1
        for i := 1 to n do
            xpower := x * xpower
            p := p + a_i * xpower
        end

    (a) How many multiplications are done in the worst case? How many additions?
    (b) How many multiplications are done on the average?
    (c) Can you improve this algorithm?

    solution:
        (a) I'm a bit confused; this algorithm has no conditionals, so the number
            of multiplications and additions depends soley on the number of
            coefficients of the polynomial. There will always 2n multiplications,
            and n additions, where n is the order of the polynomial.
        (b) See solution for (a)
        (c) I can't see any way to improve this algorithm.

2-6 Prove that the following algorithm for computing the maximum value in an array
    A[1..n] is correct.
        function max( A )
            m := A[1]
            for i := 2 to n do
                if A[i] > m then m := A[i]
        return( m )

    solution: The algorithm will always return the maximum value, as every element
              in the array is compared to the largest value found thus far,
              replacing it if it is larger. Since every element is checked, the
              algorithm will find the maximum every time.

2-7 True or false?
        (a) Is 2^(n + 1) = O(2^n)?
        (b) Is 2^(2n) = O(2^n)?

    solution:
        (a) No, it is O( 2^( n +1 ) ) // I got this wrong. It is true.
        (b) No, it is O( 2^n )


skipping a bunch of really mathy problems bc i didn't study math in school :(

2-43 You are given a set S of n numbers. You must pick a subset S' of k numbers
     from S such that the probability of each element of S occuring in S' is equal
     (i.e. each is selected with probability k/n). You may make only one pass over
     the numbers. What if n is unknown?
     solution:
        I feel that I must be misunderstanding the question, as it seems trivial
        regardless of whether n is known. Simply take the first k elements from S.
        If a uniform distribution is required and n is known, then take every 
        ((k/n) * k)th element from S. If n is unknown, I see no solution that would
        provide a uniform distribution.


2-44 We have 1,000 data items to store on 1,000 nodes. Each node can store copies
     of exactly three different items. Propose a replication scheme to minimize
     data loss as nodes fail. What is the expected number of data entries that get
     lost when three random nodes fail?
     solution:
        Assign the data entries to the nodes in a staggered manner, so that node[i]
        holds data[i], data[(i+1)%n], and data[(i+2)%n]. In order for any data to be
        lost if three random nodes fail, the three failing nodes would have to be
        sequential, and only one data entry would be lost. The probability of three
        randomly selected nodes being sequential is 0.001^2, or 1.0e-6.

2-45 Consider the following algorithm to find the minimum element in an array of
     numbers A[0,...,n]. One extra variable, tmp, is allocated to hold the current
     minimum value. Start from A[0]; "tmp" is compared against A[1], A[2], ..., A[n]
     in order. When A[i] < tmp, tmp = A[i]. What is the expected number of times
     that the assignment operation tmp = A[i] is performed?
     solution:
        In the worst case, where the array is sorted in largest-to-smallest order,
        the assignment operation is performed n times, where n is the size of the
        array.
        In the best case, where the first element is the smallest, the assignment
        operation is performed only once.
        In the average case, the assignment is performed n/2 times.

        After checking the solution, I realize I was wrong. Since the probability
        of each element being the minimum is 1/n, the average number of assignments
        approaches ln( n ) as n grows large.

2-46 You have a 100-story building and a couple of marbles. You must identify the
     lowest floor for which a marble will break if you drop it from this floor. How
     fast can you find this floor if you are given an infinite supply of marbles?
     What if you only have two marbles?
     solution:
        If I have an unlimited supply of marbles, this problem can be solved as a
        binary search tree; drop a marble at the middle floor, and if it breaks,
        move halfway down the building and repeat; if it doesn't, move halfway up
        the building and repeat until I find two consecutive floors where the 
        upper floor won't break the marble and the lower will.
        If I have only two marbles, I can still use the first marble to find if
        the middle floor will break the marble, but then if it does, I must start
        at the bottom and work my way up until I find a floor which breaks it.
        If the middle floor does not break the marble, I can continue the binary
        search algorithm, keeping track of the highest floor which will not break
        the marble, until I find a floor which does. At that point I would work up
        from one floor above the highest floor which will not break the marble
        until I find the lowest floor which will.
        With the unlimited supply of marbles, I can find the target floor in
        log_2( 100 ) ~= 6.64 drops.
        With only two marbles, the math is more complicated, but in the worst case
        I will find the target floor in 50 drops, where the target floor is the
        first one I drop a marble. In the best case, I will find the target floor 
        in three drops, where the floor below the middle floor is the target floor.

2-47 You are given 10 bags of gold coins. Nine bags contain coins that weigh 10
     grams. One bag contains false coins that all weigh one gram less. You must
     identify this bag in just one weighing. You have a digital balance that reports
     the weight of what is placed on it.
     solution:
        There must be some trick to this. Perhaps I'm allowed to remove coins and
        weigh them on their own, or shift coins from bag to bag. I assume that
        the digital balance only weighs one item or group of items at once.
        Aha! Assigning each bag a sequential number from one to ten, take that many
        coins from each bag, and weigh the pile. Subtract this weight from 
        10 * 1 + 10 * 2 + ... 10 * 10, and the result will be the number of the bag
        that has (or had, in the case where it was the bag assigned the number ten)
        the false coins. This assumes that I am able to keep track of which coins 
        came from which bag, or that the coins don't need to be returned to their bags
        at the end.

2-48 You have eight balls all of the same size. Seven of them weigh the same, and
     one of them weighs slightly more. How can you find the ball that is heavier by
     using a balance and only two weighings?
     solution:
        This is tricky; my intuition would be to treat this as a binary search
        problem, but that would take three weighings.
        Oh! Take six of the balls, and put them on the balance, three to a side.
        If the heavier ball is among them, take the three balls on the heavier
        side of the balance, and weigh two of them against one another. If the
        heavier ball is among them, we've found it, and if it's not, it's the ball
        that we didn't weigh from that group of three.
        If the heavier ball is not among the six we selected in the first step, then
        it must be one of the two remaining, so we can weigh those against each other
        to find the heavier ball.

2-49 Suppose we start with n companies that eventually merge into one big company.
     How many different ways are there for them to merge?
     solution:
        My intuition is to enumerate all the possible ways for them to merge by
        hand, but there is probably a smarter, mathier way to do it.
        Well, there are n^2 ways for the first merger to happen, and n-1^2 ways
        for the second merger to happen, all the way down to a single option for
        the last merger.
        So, you could express it as the sum from n to 1 of i^2.

2-50 A Ramanujan number can be written two different ways as the sum of two cubes--
     i.e. there exists distinct a, b, c, and d, such that a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3.
     Generate all Ramanujan numbers where a, b, c, d < n.
     solution:
        see ramanujan.cpp

2-51 Six pirates must divide $300 among themselves. The division is to proceed as
     follows. The senior pirate proposes a way to divide the money. Then the pirates
     vote. If the senior pirate gets at least half the votes, he wins, and that
     division remains. If he doesn't, he is killed and then the next senior-most
     pirate gets a chance to do the division. Now you have to tell what will happen
     and why (i.e. how many pirates survive and how is the division done)? All the
     pirates are intelligent and the first priority is to survive and the next
     priority is to get as much money as possible.
     solution:
        In order for the senior pirate to survive, they must choose to divide it so
        that at least two other pirates are happy with their share. Thus, if the
        senior pirate chooses to divide the money in three, taking one share and
        choosing two other pirates to take the other shares, those pirates are
        likely to vote in favor of this scheme.
        If the senior pirate is not allowed to vote on their own division scheme,
        then they must divide the money in four and choose three other pirates to
        receive the other shares.
        If the senior pirate wishes to guarantee that the pirates they choose
        vote in favor of their scheme, then they should choose to take a smaller
        share, and give the other pirates a larger share.

3-1 A common problem for compilers and text editors is determining whether the
    the parentheses in a string are balanced and properly nested. For example,
    the string ((())())() contains properly nested parentheses, which the string
    )()( and ()) do not. Give an algorithm that returns true if a string contains
    properly nested and balanced parentheses, and false if otherwise. For full
    credit, identify the position of the first offending parenthesis if the string
    is not properly nested and balanced.
    solution:
        see parens.cpp

3-2 Write a program to reverse the direction of a given singly-linked list. In other
    words, after the reversal all pointers should now point backwards. Your
    algorithm should take linear time.
    solution:
        see reverse.cpp.

3-3 We have seen how dynamic arrays enable arrays to grow in size while still
    achieving constant-time amortized performance. The problem concerns extending
    dynamic arrays to let them both grow and shrink on demand.
    (a) Consider an underflow strategy which cuts the array size in half whenever
        the array falls below half full. Give an example sequence of insertions and
        deletions where this strategy gives a bad amortized cost.
    (b) Then, give a better underflow strategy than that suggested above, one that
        achieves constant amortized cost per deletion.
    solution:
        (a) Suppose our array has a capacity of 16, and has 8 elements. Alternate
            deleting and inserting elements at the end, and the array will
            reallocate on every operation, giving a bad amortized cost per operation.
        (b) Only reduce the capacity of the array if the array falls below
            three-eighths full. Then, after a deletion which triggers the resizing,
            an immediate insertion will not cause another resize.

3-4 Design a dictionary data structure in which search, insertion, and deletion can
    all be processed in O(1) time in the worst case. You may assume the set
    elements are integers drawn from a finite set 1, 2, .., n, and initialization
    can take O(n) time.
    solution: I don't think the question has enough information. It doesn't
              specify what the keys are; it seems like the question is describing
              a set data structure rather than a dictionary. Apparently the
              solution is a bit array.

3-5 Find the overhead fraction (the ration of data space over total space) for each
    of the following binary tree implementations on n nodes:
    (a) All nodes store data, two child pointers, and a parent pointer. The data
        field requires four bytes and each pointer requires four bytes.
    (b) Only leaf nodes store data; internal nodes store two child pointers. The data
        field requires four bytes and each pointer requires two bytes.

    solution:
        (a) For this scenario, the tree requires 4n bytes total, n bytes of which are
            data. Thus, the overhead fraction is 1/4.
        (b) For a balanced binary tree of n nodes, there are (n+1)/2 leaf nodes, and
            n - ( (n+1)/2 ) internal nodes. So, since internal and leaf nodes happen
            to have the same total space requirement, total space is simply n * 4,
            and data space is ((n+1)/2) * 4 = ((n+1)*2). This reduces to 2n/n+1.

3-6 Describe how to modify any balanced tree data structure such that search, insert,
    delete, minimum and maximum still take O(log n) time each, but successor and
    predecessor now take O(1) time each. Which operations have to be modified to
    support this?
    solution:
        Add a pointer to each node to its predecessor and successor. Insert and
        delete must be modified to update these pointers. Insertion and deletion
        already traverse the tree to find the appropriate spot to insert or element
        to delete, so this shouldn't affect their O(log n) complexity.

3-7 Suppose you have access to a balanced dictionary data structure, which supports
    each of the operations search, insert, delete, minimum, maximum, successor and
    predecessor in O(log n) time. Explain how to modify the insert and delete
    operations so that they still take O(log n) time but minimum and maximum take
    O(1) time. Hint: think in terms of abstract dictionary operations instead of
    mucking about with pointers and the like.)
    solution:
        I don't see a solution that doesn't involve pointers. The hint is not
        helpful, as I don't understand what is meant by "abstract dictionary
        operations".
        The solution on the wiki doesn't make any sense. It says to store two
        extra elements, I'm assuming outside the tree, and to compare the values
        of inserted and deleted elements to keep these values updated. It would
        seem to me a better idea to use pointers, especially if the data items
        are large. These questions are starting to irritate me.

3-8 Design a data structure to support the following operations:
        insert( x, T ) -- insert item x into the set T
        delete( k, T ) -- delete the k-th smallest item from T
        member( x, T ) -- return true iff x is a member of T

   All operations must take O(log n) time on an n-element set.
   solution:
        Use a binary search tree, with an extra pointer in each node pointing to its
        successor. Insert would be as normal, delete would use the successor pointers
        to find the appropriate element to delete. Member would use the typical
        binary search tree search operation.

3-9 A concatenate operation takes two sets S_1 and S_2, where every key in S_1 is
    smaller than any key in S_2 and merges them together. Give an algorithm to
    concatenate two binary search trees into one binary search tree. The worst-case
    running time should be O(h) where h is the maximal height of the two trees.
    solution:
        If the trees are not required to remain balanced, take the maximum element
        of S_1, and make it the root of the new tree, with its left node the root of
        S_1 and its right node the root of S_2.

3-10 In the bin-packing problem, we are given n metal objects, each weighing
     between zero and one kg. Our goal is to find the smallest number of bins that
     will hold the n objects, with each bin holding one kg at most.
        1. The best-fit heuristic for bin packing is as follows. Consider the objects
           in the order in which they are given. For each object, place it into the
           partially filled bin with the smallest amount of extra room after the
           object is inserted. If no such bin exists, start a new bin. Design an
           algorithm which implements the best-fit heuristic (taking as input the n
           weights w_1, w_2, ..., w_n and outputting the number of bins used) in
           O(log n) time.
        2. Repeat the above with the worst-fit heuristic, where we put the next
           object in the partially filled bin with the most room after the object
           is inserted.

     solution:
        see binpacking.cpp

3-11 Suppose that we are given a sequence of values x_1, x_2, ..., x_n and seek to
     repeatedly answer queries of the form: given i and j, find the smallest value
     in x_i ... x_j
        1. Design a data structure that uses O(n^2) space and answers queries in
           O(1) time.
        2. Design a data structure that uses O(n) space and answers queries in
           O(log n) time. For partial credit, your data structure can use O(log n)
           space and have O(log n) query time.
     solution:
        see smallestij.cpp, Structure1 and Structure2 classes.
        Structure1 uses a two-dimensional vector and precalculates the minimum
        element in each range on construction, to return the minimum with a 
        simple vector access.

3-12 Suppose you are given an input set S of n numbers, and a black box that if
     given any sequence of real numbers and an integer k instantly and correctly
     answers whether there is a subset of input sequence whose sum is exactly k.
     Show how to use the black box O(n) times to find a subset of S that adds up
     to k.
     solution:
        Call the black box on the entire set S. If it returns false, there is no
        subset of S that adds up to k. Otherwise, call the black box on subsets of
        S, removing one element from the subset until the black box returns false.
        Put the removed element in a new subset S', and add it back into the black
        box testing subset, repeating (but not removing any member of S') until only
        elements of S' remain in the testing set.

3-13 Let A[1..n] be an array of real numbers. Design an algorithm to perform any
     sequence of the following operations:
        1. Add( i, y ) -- add value y to the i'th number.
        2. Partial-sum( i ) -- return the sum of the first i numbers.
     There are no insertions or deletions; the only change is to the value of the
     numbers. Each operation should take O(log n) steps. You may use one additional
     array of size n as a work space.
     solution:
        see realarray.cpp

3-16 Implement versions of several different data structures, such as linked lists,
     binary trees, balanced binary search trees, and hash tables. Conduct experiments
     to assess the relative performance of these data structures in a simple
     application that reads a large text file and reports exactly one instance of
     each word that appears within it. This application can be efficiently
     implemented by maintaining a dictionary of all distinct words that have appeared
     thus far in the text and inserting/reporting each word that is not found. Write
     a brief report with your conclusions.
     solution:
        see uniquewords.cpp

3-17 A Caesar shift (see Cryptography) is a very simple class of ciphers for secret
     messages. Unfortunately, they can be broken using a statistical property of
     English. Develop a program capable of decrypting Caesar shifts of sufficiently
     long texts.
     solution:
        see caeser_decode_stats.cpp

3-18 What method would you use to look up a word in a dictionary?
     solution:
        If we assume that the dictionary does not have any visual aids to determine
        where each letter starts, open the dictionary somewhere near the middle. If
        the word we are searching for does not lie between the first and last words
        on this page, alphabetically, repeat, choosing a spot halfway through the
        section before our selection if our word comes before in alphabetical order,
        or halfway through to section after our selection if it comes after. Repeat
        until the word is after the first word on the page, and before the last. Then,
        to find the word on the page, look at the word halfway down the page. If it
        comes before our word, look halfway down the page from there, and if it comes
        after, look halfway up the page. Repeat until the word is found.
        This method treats the problem as a binary search, since dictionaries are
        sorted in alphabetical order.

3-19 Imagine you have a closet full of shirts. What can you do to organize your shirts
     for easy retrieval?
     solution:
        I have only black shirts in my closet. I organize my shirts by style; on the
        far left are tank tops and sleeveless tees, then t shirts, then longer shirts.
        T shirts are organized with plain black shirts on the left, then graphic tees
        to their right. To find a particular shirt, I can choose a spot that is
        likely to contain the shirt I want, then move left or right depending on
        whether the selected shirt comes before or after the desired shirt in my own
        sorting order. If I had an enormous closet full of shirts, then I could apply
        a binary search strategy, but with the number of shirts I have, that is
        unnecessary.

3-20 Write a function to find the middle element of a singly-linked list.
     solution:
        see middlenode.cpp

3-21 Write a function to determine if two binary trees are identical. Identical trees
     have the same key value at each position and the same structure.
     solution:
        see treecompare.cpp

3-22 Write a program to convert a binary search tree to a linked list.
     solution:
        see treetolist.cpp

3-23 Implement an algorithm to reverse a linked list. Now do it without recursion.
     solution:
        see reverse2.cpp

3-24 What is the best data structure for maintaining URLs that have been visited by
     a web crawler? Give an algorithm to test whether a given URL has already been
     visited, optimizing both space and time.
     solution:
        see crawler.cpp
        My solution involves keeping a dictionary of sets (implemented as binary
        search trees in c++), with each set representing the collection of files
        visited in each domain. Each set is keyed by its domain name.

3-25 You are given a search string and a magazine. You seek to generate all the 
     characters in search string by cutting them out from the magazine. Give an
     algorithm to efficiently determine whether the magazine contains all the 
     letters in the search string.
     solution:
        Assuming that the magazine is in fact a physical magazine that we don't
        have in the form of a text file, it would seem that the only way to do it
        would be to look at each character in the magazine, and check whether that
        character is in the search string. Repeat until either all characters in the
        search string are accounted for, or the end of the magazine is reached.

3-26 Reverse the words in a sentence--i.e., My name is Chris becomes Chris is name
     My. Optimize for time and space.
     solution:
        see sentencereverse.cpp
        My solution involves keeping two string variables, one for constructing
        each word of the input, and one for constructing the total output. My 
        algorithm iterates over the input string only once. I suppose it would be
        possible to do without the word variable, and to use an integer counter or
        a pointer to keep track of the appropriate point in the output string to put
        new characters.

3-27 Determine whether a linked list contains a loop as quickly as possible without
     using any extra storage. Also, identify the location of the loop.
     solution:
        see listloop.cpp
        I used two pointers, and iterated through the list twice as fast with one of
        them, checking if the faster-moving pointer pointed to a node which had the
        node pointed to by the slower-moving pointer as its next node. If a pointer
        ever is set to NULL, then it is clear that the list has no loop.

3-28 You have an unordered array X of n integers. Find the array M containing n
     elements where M_i is the product of all integers in X except for X_i. You may
     not use division. You can use extra memory. (Hint: There are solutions faster
     than O(n^2).)
     solution:
        see findproduct.cpp
        I first implemented the naive, O(n^2) solution, using nested iteration over
        X, multiplying all elements except X_i.
        Then, I thought about how to improve it; I though of keeping another array
        of pairwise products, so that I could iterate over that as the nested loop
        instead, and perform fewer multiplications overall. For M[i], start at 
        pair_products[i + 1] and multiply every other member of pair_products, using
        modulo to wrap around the array boundary, until reaching i - 1. Do not use
        pair_products[i - 1], but rather X[i - 1]. Put the result in M[i].

3-29 Give an algorithm for finding an ordered word pair (e.g., New York) occurring
     with the greatest frequency in a given webpage. Which data structures would you
     use? Optimize both time and space.
     solution:
        see wordpair.cpp

4-1 The Grinch is given the job of partitioning 2n players into two teams of n
    players each. Each player has a numerical rating that measures how good they are
    at the game. He seeks to divide the players as unfairly as possible, so as to
    create the biggest possible talent imbalance between team A and team B.
    Show how the Grinch can do the job in O(nlogn) time. 
    solution:
        see grinch.cpp
        My solution is to take the players, and put them on either the good team or
        the bad team, depending on whether their skill score is higher or lower than
        half the maximum score. The teams are represented by std::multiset, which
        are implemented as binary search trees.
        After the initial sorting, in O(n) time, the teams are balanced by taking the
        larger team, and if it is the good team, repeatedly moving the player with
        the minimum score to the bad team, and if it is the bad team, moving the
        player with the maximum score to the good team.
        Finally, the maximum element of the bad team is compared to the minimum
        element of the good team, and they are swapped if the bad team player is
        better than the good team player. This is repeated until the best bad team
        player is worse than the worst good team player.

4-2 For each of the following problems, give an algorithm that finds the desired
    numbers within the given amount of time. To keep your answers brief, feel free
    to use algorithms from the book as subroutines. For the example,
    S={6,13,19,3,8}, 19−3 maximizes the difference, while 8−6 minimizes the
    difference. 
    (a) Let S be an unsorted array of n integers. Give an algorithm that finds the
        pair x,y∈S that maximizes |x−y|. Your algorithm must run in O(n) worst-case
        time. 
    (b) Let S be a sorted array of n integers. Give an algorithm that finds the pair
        x,y∈S that maximizes |x−y|. Your algorithm must run in O(1) worst-case time. 
    (c) Let S be an unsorted array of n integers. Give an algorithm that finds the 
        pair x,y∈S that minimizes |x−y|, for x≠y. Your algorithm must run in O(nlogn)
        worst-case time. 
    (d) Let S be a sorted array of n integers. Give an algorithm that finds the pair
        x,y∈S that minimizes |x−y|, for x≠y. Your algorithm must run in O(n) 
        worst-case time.
    solution:
        see findnumbers.cpp

4-3 Take a sequence of 2n real numbers as input. Design an O(nlogn) algorithm that
    partitions the numbers into n pairs, with the property that the partition 
    minimizes the maximum sum of a pair. For example, say we are given the numbers 
    (1,3,5,9). The possible partitions are ((1,3),(5,9)), ((1,5),(3,9)), and 
    ((1,9),(3,5)). The pair sums for these partitions are (4,14), (6,12), and 
    (10,8). Thus the third partition has 10 as its maximum sum, which is the minimum
    over the three partitions.
    solution:
        see pairpartition.cpp
        My solution involves first sorting the input sequence using an O(nlogn)
        sorting algorithm, then taking the maximum and minimum elements and putting
        them into pairs. This will minimize the maximum sum among pairs.

4-4 Assume that we are given n pairs of items as input, where the first item is a 
    number and the second item is one of three colors (red, blue, or yellow). Further
    assume that the items are sorted by number. Give an O(n) algorithm to sort the
    items by color (all reds before all blues before all yellows) such that the
    numbers for identical colors stay sorted. For example: (1,blue), (3,red), 
    (4,blue), (6,yellow), (9,red) should become (3,red), (9,red), (1,blue), (4,blue),
    (6,yellow).
    solution:
        see numbercolor.cpp
        My solution involves keeping a vector for each color, and appending the
        elements of the input sequence to the appropriate vector for its color.
        Since the input sequence is already sorted by number, the color vectors will
        retain the sorted order. Once the input sequence is partitioned into colors,
        the color vectors are merged in the appropriate order to create the output
        sequence.

4-5 The mode of a set of numbers is the number that occurs most frequently in the 
    set. The set (4,6,2,4,3,1) has a mode of 4. Give an efficient and correct 
    algorithm to compute the mode of a set of n numbers.
    solution:
        see mode.cpp

4-6 Given two sets S1 and S2 (each of size n), and a number x, describe an O(nlogn)
    algorithm for finding whether there exists a pair of elements, one from S1 and
    one from S2, that add up to x. (For partial credit, give a Θ(n2) algorithm for
    this problem.)
    solution:
        see findpairsum.cpp

4-7. Outline a reasonable method of solving each of the following problems. Give the
     order of the worst-case complexity of your methods.

     1. You are given a pile of thousands of telephone bills and thousands of checks
        sent in to pay the bills. Find out who did not pay.
     2. You are given a list containing the title, author, call number and publisher
        of all the books in a school library and another list of 30 publishers. Find
        out how many of the books in the library were published by each company.
     3. You are given all the book checkout cards used in the campus library during 
        the past year, each of which contains the name of the person who took out
        the book. Determine how many distinct people checked out at least one book.
     solution:
        1. Sort only the bills by the name of the customer. Take the pile of checks
           and find the associated bill for each. Any bill left without an associated
           check is unpaid. Sorting the bills can be accomplished in O(nlogn) time,
           and then pairing will take O(mlogn) time, since searching the bill pile
           after sorting can be accomplished in O(logn) time, where n is the number
           of bills, and m is the number of checks. Thus, the total complexity is
           O(nlogn + mlogn).
        2. Keep a total for each publisher. Go through the list, and increment the
           total for each publisher as their book appears on the list. This will take
           O(nm + m) time, where n is the length of the list and m is the number of 
           publishers (assume that the publisher counts are kept in a hashmap 
           dictionary). 
        3. Keep a unique-key binary search tree of people. Go through the list of 
           cards, attempting to insert the name into the set. Once done with the 
           cards, the size of the tree is the number of people who checked out at
           least one book. This would run in O(nlogm) time, where n is the number of
           cards and m is the number of unique people who checked out at least one
           book.

4-8 Given a set of S containing n real numbers, and a real number x. We seek an
    algorithm to determine whether two elements of S exist whose sum is exactly x.

    1. Assume that S is unsorted. Give an O(nlogn) algorithm for the problem.
    2. Assume that S is sorted. Give an O(n) algorithm for the problem.
    solution:
        see realpairsum.cpp

4-9 Give an efficient algorithm to compute the union of sets A and B, where 
    n=max(|A|,|B|). The output should be an array of distinct elements that form the
    union of the sets, such that they appear more than once in the union.

    1. Assume that A and B are unsorted. Give an O(nlogn) algorithm for the problem.
    2. Assume that A and B are sorted. Give an O(n) algorithm for the problem.
    solution:
        see union.cpp

4-10 Given a set S of n integers and an integer T, give an O(n^(k−1)logn) algorithm 
     to test whether k of the integers in S add up to T.
     solution:
        see testsum.cpp
        My solution involves first sorting S, in descending order. Then the k
        largest elements are summed, and if they are smaller than T, then there is
        no way to get a sum of T. Likewise, the k smallest elements are summed, and
        if they are larger than T, there is no way to get a sum of T.
        At this point, if we haven't ruled out a solution, then we start looping
        through bitsets representing all the permutations of k elements from S, and
        using those bitsets to select elements from S, summing them and checking them
        against T. If we find a subset, then we return true. If we get through all
        the permutations and don't find a subset summing to T, we return false.

4-11 Design an O(n) algorithm that, given a list of n elements, finds all the 
     elements that appear more than n/2 times in the list. Then, design an O(n)
     algorithm that, given a list of n elements, finds all the elements that appear
     more than n/4 times.
     solution:
        see findfrequent.cpp

4-12 Devise an algorithm for finding the k smallest elements of an unsorted set of n
     integers in O(n+klogn).
     solution:
        see ksmallest.cpp

4-13 You wish to store a set of n numbers in either a max-heap or a sorted array. 
     For each application below, state which data structure is better, or if it does
     not matter. Explain your answers.
     1. Want to find the maximum element quickly.
     2. Want to be able to delete an element quickly.
     3. Want to be able to form the structure quickly.
     4. Want to find the minimum element quickly.
     solution:
        1. Either a max-heap or sorted array will allow access to the maximum
           element in O(1) time.
        2. A max-heap will allow an element to be deleted in O(1) time, while a
           sorted array will have to be reorganized in O(n) time with the deletion
           of any element except the maximum.
        3. Either a max-heap or sorted array will require up to n restructurings
           during construction, so either would be equally as bad with an unsorted
           input sequence.
        4. A sorted array would be better, as it allows access to the minimum element
           in O(1) time, while a max-heap requires O(logn) time. If we could use a
           min-heap instead, it would be just as good as a sorted array.

4-14 Give an O(nlogk)-time algorithm that merges k sorted lists with a total of n 
     elements into one sorted list. (Hint: use a heap to speed up the elementary 
     O(kn)-time algorithm).
     solution:
        I gave up on this one.

4-15 (a) Give an efficient algorithm to find the second-largest key among n keys.
         You can do better than 2n−3 comparisons. 
     (b) Then, give an efficient algorithm to find the third-largest key among n 
         keys. How many key comparisons does your algorithm do in the worst case?
         Must your algorithm determine which key is largest and second-largest in
         the process?
